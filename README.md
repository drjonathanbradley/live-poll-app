A React App used to poll against and save data to an API. You will need a working API endpoint for you data, such as Dreamfactory, and key-based access. Add this information to a config.js file and add it to the src folder.

The repo includes an example data schema for the questions. You will need to replicate this for this structure to work.

Once you have the config file setup and are ready to try testing, you can do npm run start or yarn start from the commandline. If you are ready to build the project to deploy, use npm run build or yarn build and the project will create a folder called build with your files for transferring to a server or running directly in the browser.
